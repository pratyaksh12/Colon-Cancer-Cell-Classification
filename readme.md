**Author:** Pratyaksh Basel (s4011284)

## Description

This repository contains the Python script for a multi-class classification task, completed as part of Assignment 2 for the RMIT course COSC2673 (Machine Learning).

## Important Information

- The script was developed and executed in **Google Colab** using **GPU acceleration** for training and data processing.
- **Do not run this script locally.** The dataset is accessed directly from my **Google Drive** and is not included in this repository or any local folders.
- The dataset used is **identical** to the one provided by the RMIT teaching team for Assignment 2 of **COSC2673**.
- If the notebook appears to be missing outputs or results, please refer to the live Colab version linked below.
